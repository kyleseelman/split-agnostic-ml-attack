# Split-Agnostic Meta-learning Evasion (SAME) Attack
To train the MAML algorithm from scratch, we follow the structure of https://github.com/oscarknagg/few-shot/tree/672de83a853cc2d5e9fe304dc100b4a735c10c15
Pretrained models are included and referenced in meta_attack.py. However, probably need to change file path respective to your system. 

To run attack with pre-trained MAML simply run 'python meta_attack.py'
